<h3>Governance and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence</h3>

<p>I am currently teaching "Governance and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence" at Syracuse University. It is an upper-level undergraduate seminar that I designed.</p>

<p>This class uses a cross-disciplinary approach to study how tech companies, national governments, international organizations, and civil society groups could manage the development and deployment of AI in the public interest. The class material draws upon research in political science, public policy, philosophy, legal studies, economics, and computer science. Topics include algorithmic fairness; privacy, transparency, and safety; automation and the future of work; the impact of AI on international security.</p>

<p>In recent years, the ethics of AI has become a burgeoning field of study, with various institutions articulating AI ethics principles. But as tech companies and governmental bodies seek to implement policies to manage the technology, how to govern AI has become a deeply political question. While this class touches on the central debates in AI ethics, it emphasizes the political and public policy dimensions of AI governance.</p>

<h3>Introduction to American Politics</h3>
			
<p>I taught "Introduction to American Politics" during <a href="https://summer.yale.edu/">Yale Summer Session</a> 2018. In my role as lecturer, I designed the syllabus, delivered lectures, led interactive workshops, and evaluated all student works.</p>

<p>The course was an introduction to the study of American government and politics. In five short weeks, the course covered a wide range of topics, including the constitutional foundations of the U.S., political institutions, mass politics, the media, political parties, and interest groups. Students explored other topics of interest to them through essay assignments. Besides acquiring substantive knowledge about American politics, students also learned how to think like political scientists by reading and discussing contemporary works in the discipline.</p>

<p>I have served as a teaching fellow in the following Yale University courses.</p>

<h3>Advanced Quantitative Methods</h3>
<p>Instructor: <a href="https://www.allandafoe.com/">Allan Dafoe</a> (Fall 2016)</p>

<button class="collapsible">Course Description</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The aim of this course is to provide students with the understanding and tools to critically consume and conduct statistical research. The theme is the challenge of drawing reliable causal inference. We will learn: how to use graphical methods to transparently analyze and present data; how to discipline our analyses against multiple-comparisons bias; how to use nonparametric methods to avoid implausible assumptions; how strong research design is essential to causal inference; how Bayesian inference provides the mathematical vocabulary for thinking about scientific inference; how causal graphs allow us to express and analyze causal assumptions, choose control variables, and think about selection bias; how placebo tests allow us to test assumptions; how to build and understand Likelihood and Bayesian models including Logistic and Probit models; how to think about and analyze time-series cross-sectional data. We will review instrumental variables methods and regression-discontinuity designs.</p>
