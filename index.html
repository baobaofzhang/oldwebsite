			<p>I am an assistant professor of <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/psc/">Political Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/">Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs</a> at Syracuse University. I am also a <a href="https://cifar.ca/cifar-azrieli-global-scholars/">CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar</a> and a research affiliate with the <a href="https://governance.ai/">Centre for the Governance of AI</a>.</p>

			<p>My current research focuses on trust in digital technology and the governance of artificial intelligence (AI). I study (1) public and elite opinion toward AI, (2) how the American welfare state could adapt to the increasing automation of labor, and (3) attitudes toward Covid-19 surveillance technology. My previous research covered a wide range of topics, including the politics of the U.S. welfare state, attitudes towards climate change, and survey methodology.</p>

            <p>I graduated with a PhD in political science (2020) and an MA in statistics (2015) from Yale University. In 2020-2021, I worked as a Klarman Postdoctoral Fellow in the Cornell Society of Fellows. In 2019-2020, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow in MITâ€™s <a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/">Political Science Department</a> and a fellow at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> at Harvard University.</p>
